    - Implement quality gates (Linting, Unit Tests) in the pipeline.
    - Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place.

3.  **Monitoring & Security**:
    - Set up monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack).
    - Scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies and container images.
    - Manage secrets securely (Vault, Environment Variables).
